# Lecture 3: Introduction to containers

A multi-part session that aims to cover various basic concepts and techniques when working with containers. The journey starts with a single **Docker** host. Then, once the basics are covered, will move on to a single **k3s** host. It will be used to do a transition to the **Kubernetes** way of working with containers. Finally, if the time allows, a three-node **k3s** cluster will be created.

The supporting files have the following organization:

```

├── images        ---> supporting images for some of the documents

├── demo.pdf      ---> a PDF version of the demo document

├── homework.pdf  ---> a PDF version of the homework document (the same is available at the end of the demo.md file)
